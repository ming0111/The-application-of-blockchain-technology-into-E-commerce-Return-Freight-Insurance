# The-application-of-blockchain-technology-into-E-commerce-Return-Freight-Insurance
ABSTRACT  
In this paper, I researched how to construct a detailed solution with mathematical models for the application of blockchain in Return Freight Insurance (RI). In this e-commerce era, more and more people go shopping online, and a new insurance product – Return Freight Insurance was created to improve the return or exchange process. Although the industry grows fast, there are unavoidable problems faced by insurance companies – high claim ratios, claim fraud and short-term capital management. Meanwhile, the features of RI are compatible with the characteristics of blockchain technology, which leads to an idea of the application. Firstly, by leveraging the decentralized and automated system, customized pricing and claim model were constructed to reduce the high claim ratio. Next, a membership hierarchy was designed to avoid fraud. Furthermore, tokenomics and crypto staking pools were introduced to help capital management and keep the funds operating continuously. Although there are still risks of regulations and business development, the solution worked out most of the problems faced by RI and can be running perpetually because of the token burnt mechanism in the pricing and claim model. This solution is feasible and it can renovate the RI industry to the next age.
